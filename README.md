This is an introductory tutorial on the management software for aesthetic medical centers, also known as medical spas. This software was developed using the FileMaker platform and is called Patuj√∫ v.2.
The spa management system is structured into four main areas, organized according to business logic:
Customer Service
Inventory Management
Cash Flow
Accounting
Additionally, there is a configuration section where users can enter the company's name and address, upload a logo, and customize other variables.
The Client Module includes:
A database for registering clients.
A scheduling system for booking appointments.
A catalog of available services.
A package management system that bundles multiple services at a special price.
Finally, the Sales Module allows users to record each client visit, detailing the services or products consumed, and process payments accordingly.
